1.tsp
calls getnextpermutation until permutations exist and then calls getcost on the permutation ,if the cost is <min then min =cost and after the loop is over min is returned.

2.printpath
calls tsp to get the minimum cost and then runs a loop for all possible permutations and if cost of the permutation is = min cost the permuation is returned

3.getcost
returns the cost of the permuatation by adding the cost of travelling from one node to another.
