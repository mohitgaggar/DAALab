There are 3 functions in the c file
1.int searchFirstOccurrence(int arr[], int n, int key)
2.int searchLastOccurrence(int arr[], int n, int key)
3.int numOccurrences(int arr[], int n, int key)

1.
in the first function we start a for loop that runs from 0 to n-1 and checks if the array element is equal to key(arr[i]==key)
if it is equal then we directly return i
if it is not equal the loop keeps continuing and when control comes out of the loop then -1 is returned which means key wasnt found.

3.
in the third function we declare a variable count initialized to 0 and start a for loop that runs from 0 to n-1 and checks if the array element is equal to key(arr[i]==key)
if it is equal then we increment count.
if it is not equal the loop keeps continuing without incrementing count.
when control comes out of the loop count is returned.
